Airline Project 
    - Create a WPF project to manage the flights/front desk for an airline
    - Your application must keep track of a number of flights.
    - Your airline will have a number of aircrafts
    - Each aircraft must have:
        o Passenger capacity
        o Range (how far the aircraft will travel)
        o Maintenance status 
        o Schedule
    - Each flight will have:
        o An aircraft assigned to it
        o Flight number
        o Origin
        o Destination
        o Passenger manifest.
    - You need the ability to sell a seat on any given flight
        o Each seat on a flight should have a price
        o When selling a seat, the passengers information should be added to the passenger manifest
    - Your User Interface (UI) should not contain any business logic and should not directly display stuff from     the     file reader class or directly write     to a file.
    - Feel free to choose file type for storing data: text, XML, JSON are all options
    - Use separation of responsibility. 
        o For example, you will need a file reader class and a file writer class.
    - Concentrate on the code. Work on polishing your UI only after your code is complete and working.
